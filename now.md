This is what I'm currently busy with:

* Being Director of Engineering at Colibri Learning (McKissock LLC)
* Writing a lot of C# (.net core) and the occasional TypeScript
* DevOps with Docker, Docker Swarm, AWS, and Terraform.
* Reading books to learn how to better myself and the world around me
* Skateboarding, rowing, biking, and occasionally weightlifting
* Dancing
