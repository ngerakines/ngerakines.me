Experience

Facebook Application Development                     Published February 2008
I am the author of the book "Facebook Application Development" (John Wiley
&amp; Sons, Inc, published 2008). The book is part of the Wrox Professional
Series and covers all aspects of Facebook application development. The book
is packed with example projects and source code to give readers a very
hands-on guide. The book includes several open source projects covering a
variety of topics spanning several thousand lines of code.

Sr. Software Engineer (Blizzard Entertainment) February 2010 - Present
I am largely reponsible for a handful of projects and services ranging from
the search system used throughout all of the community sites to a distributed
image rendering farm. One of my larger projects is the World of Warcraft
API, a multi-region RESTful web service that churns over 400 million requests
a month. Recently, I have been playing a large role in the migration to Git
and Maven.

Platform Architect, Rupture (Electronic Arts) November 2008 - February 2010
I played several key roles within the EA Online organization and within
Rupture. First and foremost, I built the Rupture Platform team and
bootstrapped the technologies used by that team. This included advanced
data storage, processing and queuing models. I also introduced eJabberd to
EA, helping reduce the cost of owning and operating instant message services
used by game teams.

Software Engineer, del.icio.us (Yahoo)         November 2006 - November 2008
As a software Engineer at Yahoo I've worked on several different teams
within the company. The first group was the del.icio.us team as a back-end
engineer developing the del.icio.us 2.0 system. This included a project
dubbed TagWeb, a federated data-store over Apache and MySQL. I worked
closely with the front-end and back-end teams to design and implement the
communication protocol between the two systems and also wrote an extensive
test suite to cover the protocol.

I also designed and implemented a number of secondary systems throughout
the back-end including a complex spam demographics and abuse detection
system, the Facebook application and the del.icio.us 1.0 to 2.0 migration
system.

Software Engineer, SixApart                      January 2006 - October 2006
Lead feature development on the TypePad product. This includes working on
the FeedBurner and Tucows integration involving cross platform development.
Also worked on the TypePad-Mogile project. While at SixApart I've made
several contributions to the open source community. Prototyped experimental
API using the then evolving standard (Atom).

Lead Developer, Feedster                      September 2005 - December 2005
Developed production mesh Linux server network with node auto-discovery to
support dynamic service redistribution. Reengineered pure Perl web crawler,
increasing throughput by 2400% (8,000,000 urls/day). Implemented massive
database caching and write buffering system for new and existing services.
Developed language and encoding detection libraries in C to support the
internationalization efforts. Applied a complex spam scoring and detection
system. Integrated diverse spam-detecting techniques including Bayesian,
clustering, time-weighted scoring, and black/white/grey listing.

Projects and Personal Experience

Facebook Application: I Play WoW
I Play WoW is a Facebook application that bridges the two social worlds of
Facebook and Blizzard's World of Warcraft. The application was originally
written in Perl over Catalyst with Memcached and MySQL. As the application
started to grow parts of it were moved to Erlang and CouchDB.

Social Network Community Participation: I am an active member in a number of
developer communities appertaining to several major social networks.

Erlang Community Participation: I have been a very active member in the
Silicon Valley Erlang community. I've actively organized events,
presentations and have contributed to advancement of Erlang in the Silicon
Valley.

Open Source Contributions: I've got over several dozen contributions to the
open source projects including several original projects of my own in a
a variety of languages.
