In December 2016, I started writing a book about creating and managing Docker Swarm infrastructure in AWS using Packer and Terraform. It was a lengthy book clocking in at 230 pages in 7 chapters out of 11 chapters total, not including source code. Ultimately, I came to the conclusion that it was trying to do too much and was spread too thinly across all of the topics and best practices that it was trying to cover. It was shelved (no pun intented) so that I could life and work changes attention.

In October 2017, I picked up that project again and broke it into several smaller guides that cover specific topics. One of those was **Managing AWS with Terraform** and I began the process of self-publishing that book. Well, after several months of research, writing, and editing, I'm extremely pleased to announce that it is published and available for purchase.

My goal for 2018 is to publish 3 titles that are between 10,000 and 15,000 words. Some of the topics that I'm exploring involve managing AWS with Terraform for entireprise and large footprints, as well as automating and using Jenkins for continuous integration and continuous delivery.
