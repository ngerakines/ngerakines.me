        I&#8217;m pretty active on the usual social places including <a href="http://github.com/ngerakines">GitHub</a>, <a href="http://pinboard.in/u:ngerakines">pinboard.in</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/ngerakines">twitter</a> and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/ngerakines">Facebook</a>. I prefer email over instant messaging but will also respond to Facebook messages.

        I fall into the &#8220;casual gamer&#8221; category and can be found playing the World of Warcraft character Korale. I&#8217;ve been featured on one of WoW Insider&#8217;s 15 Minutes of Fame as well as a few others because of this Facebook application that I wrote called I Play WoW.
