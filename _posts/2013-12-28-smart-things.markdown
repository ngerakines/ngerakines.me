I've been playing around with [Smart Things](http://smartthings.com/) and wrote a few small applications for it. These are pretty specific to my needs (and my house), but demonstrate how easy it is to write custom applications for the platform.

This first application is used to turn the office lights on when I'm home and there is activity in the office. It makes use of a motion sensor in the office, a zwave lightswitch that I installed in the room and a presense sensor that I have on my keychain.

All of the code can be found on GitHub: [https://github.com/ngerakines/miniature-dubstep](https://github.com/ngerakines/miniature-dubstep)
