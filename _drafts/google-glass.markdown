When I received the email inviting me to the Glass Explorer program, I was elated. I truly love technology and get a thrill out of making things that have never been made before. When my Glass arrived in the mail in late November 2013, it didn't take long to start playing with the Mirror API. Since I've had them for about a month now, I have a few observations and comments.

* The best gadgets and pieces of technology that I own are the ones that fad into the background when I'm not using them. What I love about glass is that once you've been wearing them for a short while (it took about a week for me), you don't notice that they are there unless you want to use them.
* The battery life isn't good, but it doesn't take long to get a full charge.
* My experience with the device after unplugging it is pretty poor. Sometimes after unplugging it from the charger, the screen doesn't show up and the only way to get it back is by holding down the power button and doing a hard restart of the device.

My first Glassware was a Fitbit/Glass bridge. Using the Mirror API and the Fitbit API, when you link your two accounts it would periodically send cards to Glass.
