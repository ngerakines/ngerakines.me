There is a lot going on these days, and much of it has to do with your safety, security, and privacy.

## Use social media, but don't trust social media

Facebook, Twitter, etc have one purpose: to monetize your relationships. Never forget that. The "values" and "purpose" that social media sites utter are banal platitudes that have no value in the age of fake news.

You should avoid, at all costs, using social media websites for sharing and communicating sensitive information.

* Your account could get hacked.
* Your account could be deleted.
* Your account information could be sold.
* The government can view and access your account.

Now, it is easy to say "well that doesn't apply to me, I'm a pleb" and think that you'll be targeted. You are wrong.

* Websites get hacked and credentials sold/shipped. Not all websites are secured equally and the site you signed up for last week can be hacked and your email address/password can be used across the web.
* Your affiliation with groups, tags, and organizations can make you a target. Use the hashtag resist or nevertrump ever?
* Your affiliations with other people can also make you a target. Friend of a friend travel internationally? Friend of a friend of a friend who participated in a protest?
* Your travel history and plans can make you a target.

I'm not saying that you should delete your Facebook or Twitter account. I'm saying that you shouldn't use it for anything that compromised you or the people you have relationships with.

## Use secure means of communication for sensitive information

There are some great alternatives to Facebook messages, Twitter direct messages, Snapchat, etc for safely and securely connecting with people.

Both Signal and WhatsApp are both secure *and* easy to use. They have a wide range of features including multimedia, files, and group messaging. They also provide simple ways to verify the identity of contacts.

## Use unique passwords whenever possible

Another relatively small step you can take, is to use different passwords for all of the sites and services you use. This comes along with the recommendation that you use a secure password manager.

Here is an example of why you should do this.

1. You sign up for an account on example.com with your email and password.
2. The site example.com gets hacked and your email and password compromised.
3. Your account credentials (email and password) are used to try to log into common sites like Facebook, Twitter, Instigram, etc
4. Because you use the same password on those sites, there is a match and your social media accounts are compromised.

Now imagine the above scenario with a chilling detail: what if instead of Facebook, it was your bank or your electric company.

With a password manager, like 1Password, you can have different passwords for all of your accounts and that are accessible to you on your computer or phone. Browser extensions and iOS/Android extensions make it easy and convient to follow this practice.

## Use two-factor authentication and login notifications whenever possible

There is a growing number of websites including Apple, Google, Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter (and many many) that support two factor authentication. Use that whenever possible. Use it with your bank and financial accounts. Use it for your utility and service accounts. Use it for your social media accounts.

A lot of websites also provide login notification emails. Enable that whenever possible. They can provide crutial information that an attack against you is taking place or that you are being targeted.

## Secure your devices

Having strong passwords, a password manager, and two-factor authentication are links in the chain, so to speak. Your devices also play an important part in the security of your online identity and information.

At home and in secure locations, you should secure your data with encryption and physical protection. With macOS, Windows, and Linux you can use disk encryption. Disk encryption works when your device is off, so get in the habbit of turning your computer, even your laptop, off off when you leave it unattanded and it isn't in your immediate area. When you travel, like on a plane or are driving, you should also get in the habbit of turning it off.

If you backup your computer (and you should), use disk encryption when possible and secure your backups in a small fireproof vault or safe.

If you use USB drives to transfer files and content or for temporary storage, use disk encryption when possible and remember to securely wipe devices occasionally.

## Travel safely

If you are going to or from a sensitive or monitored location such as a protest or meetup, you can take a few simple precautions to ensure your communications are safe.

First, think about what is necessary to bring and leave everything else at home. If you are going to a march and you are going with people and plan on being with them the entire time, consider not bringing your phone. It may also feel natural to bring your laptop or tablet, but consider not bringing that as well.

If you do need to bring your phone, secure it with a password, not a quick entry pin or sequence. Also remove any fingerprint login features if they are enabled.

# Getting started

It starts with you. Encourage your coworkers, friends, and family to use Signal (or WhatsApp). If someone sends you revealing or sensitive information in an insecure way, respectfully tell them to stop.
