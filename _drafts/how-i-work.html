title: How I Work
category: posts

I love reading the [how-i-work](http://lifehacker.com/how-i-work/) posts on life hacker. They aren't the first to do that sort of series, but there is a really good mix of writers, industry leaders, software engineers and designers to really expose some cool tools and processes.

I'm also interested in how things change and people adapt over the years. With that, here is a small blurb about how I work.

Current gig: Software Engineer
Location: Irvine, CA, USA
Current mobile device: Galaxy Nexus
Current computer: MSI Laptop, 17 inch dual booting windows (SSD) and ubuntu (platter) with 12G ram.
One word that best describes how you work: TBD

**What apps/software/tools can't you live without?**

A solid Linux install that keeps itself clean and up to date so that I don't have to deal with that. Currently using Ubuntu but have a long history with Red Hat and Gentoo. I use sublime text whenever I'mnot using Vim. I've been using Chrome for a few years now, although I'm considering moving back to Firefox with all of the improvements they've made.

For Java development, I really couldn't live without Intellij. I use it for both professional and personal projects and gladly paid for a license to use at home.

To manage the incoming flood of information, I use pinboard and google reader. I'm not sure where I'll move to once it goes away.

I also really like Steam. Being able to not deal with game updates and the complexity of patches and add-on packs is really nice.

**What's your workspace setup like?**

Standard V shape desk with two monitors. Given that a lot of what I do is web development, being able to full screen an IDE (IntelliJ) on one and a browser on another is really useful. On my desk shelf are some personal artifacts from different projects and teams over the years. I've also got my "grand master dad" (father's day 2012) trophy from Vanessa.

Next to my desk is a large bookshelf where everything else goes. Signed games, collectors edition scuptures, whiskey glasses, collectables and an assortment of books and manuals.

**What do you listen to while you work?**

I use Pandora pretty heavily. When there is something specific that I want to listen to, I'll pull up Amazon Cloudplayer. I used to spend a lot of time managing playlists and whatnot, but over the years came to the conclusion that I listen to music to help me think and code (for the most part) so I don't really care what it is.

**What's your best time-saving trick?**

Doing one thing at a time. I put a lot of effort into not multi-tasking. If I need to change or context switch, I'll close everything out so that the next thing has 100% of my attention and focus.

**What's your favorite to-do list manager?**

~/Documents/todo/todo.txt

**Besides your phone and computer, what gadget can't you live without?**

TBD

**What's your sleep routine like?**

I'm usually asleep by midnight and I get up between 6a and 7a. I'll usually skip breakfast and grab and early lunch around 11a.
